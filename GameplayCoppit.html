 <h3>Equipment</h3>
 Coppit is a roll-and-move game for 2 to 6 players. Each player has four cone-shaped pieces 
<br> that stack when placed on top of each other. The board consists of a series of pathways, 
<br> laid out in the shape of a wheel. Each player starts with his pieces on his home space. 
 <br>(The coloured "doors" in the picture below). The aim of the game is to move around the 
 <br>pathways 'copping' your opponents pieces by landing on top of them, then racing to get the 
 <br>captured pieces back to your home, where they will be taken out of play. The winner is
<br> the last player to have any pieces in play.


 
 <h3> Instrcutions</h3> 

  1)Players roll the die. Highest roll starts.
<br> 2) On his turn, a player rolls the die. He can move any one piece the exact number of spaces as
  <br> shown on the die. If a 6 was rolled, the player moves his piece then immediately rolls again.
<br> 3)Pieces may not reverse direction in the middle of a move.
<br> 4)If the player can land on the same space as an opponent's piece, by exact count,
<br> then the player 'cops' his opponent's piece by placing his piece on top.
 <br>5)A stack of pieces is controlled by the player whose piece is at the top of the stack.
<br> The stack is moved as a single unit.
 <br>6)If, when 'copping' an opponent's stack, the player captures pieces of his own colour,
<br> those pieces are immediately freed (removed from the stack) and placed on the same space.
<br> 7)The 'birdsnest' spaces (pink spaces in some editions) are 'safe' spaces -- pieces on these spaces cannot be captured.
<br> 8)If a player can move a stack into his home base, all opponent's pieces are permanently captured and removed from the game.
<br> 9)An exact count is not required to get home. If, for example, a player is 2 spaces away and throws a 5,
<br> he moves 2 spaces into home (leaving permanently captured pieces there) then moves another 3 spaces out again.
 <br>10)When a player's last piece is captured, he is out of the game.




<h3>Winning</h3>

<br> The winner is the last player to have pieces left in the game.
